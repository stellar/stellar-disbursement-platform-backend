## [2.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend/releases/tag/2.1.0-rc.1) ([diff](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend/compare/2.0.0...2.1.0-rc.1))

Release of the Stellar Disbursement Platform v2.0.0. This release introduces
the option to set different distribution account signers per tenant, as well
as Circle support, so the tenant can choose to run their payments through the
Circle API rather than directly on the Stellar network.

This version is only compatible with the [stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-frontend] version `2.1.0-rc.1`.

## [1.0.0.rc1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1)

### Added

First Release Candidate of the Stellar Disbursement Platform, a tool used to make bulk payments to a list of recipients
based on their phone number and a confirmation date. This repository is backend-only, and the frontend version can be
found at [stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-frontend]. Their version numbers are meant to be kept in sync.

The basic process of this product starts with an organization supplying a CSV file which includes the recipients' phone
number, transfer amount, and essential customer validation data such as the date of birth.

The platform subsequently sends an SMS to the recipient, which includes a deep link to the wallet. This link permits
recipients with compatible wallets to register their wallet on the SDP. During this step, they are required to verify
their phone number and additional customer data through the [SEP-24] interactive deposit flow, where this data is shared
directly with the backend through a webpage inside the wallet, but the wallet itself does not have access to this data.

Upon successful verification, the SDP will transfer the funds directly to the recipient's wallet. When the recipient's
wallet has been successfully associated with their phone number in the SDP, all subsequent payments will occur
automatically.
